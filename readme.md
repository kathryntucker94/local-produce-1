### Overview
A website to provide users with a "one-stop-shop" for accessing local producers of produce and meat products. Growers/producers can log in, create a highlight page and allow costumers to search for their goods. This will provide a convenient platform for micro-growers and backyard farmers. It will promote a sense of community, bolster the local economy, and reduce the carbon footprint of one's purchases.

### Features

*User Roles- Customers will have access to different features than the supplier.
